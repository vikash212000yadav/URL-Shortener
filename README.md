# URL Shortener

Wep app used to shorten the long URLs, using <i>hashlib</i> to import the Python standard library that will be used to create a <i>hash</i> of the URL.

A service that takes any URL and generates a shorter, more readable version-while diving into <i>[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) </i> concepts, like [queries and mutations](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/), and tools, like the <i>GraphiQL Interface</i>.

You may already have used such services before, like <i>bit.ly</i>.
